# Network-throttling
Network or I.S.P. throttling is one of the greta crimes of this day and age. I would like to try to create an application that blows throttling out of existence. In Dev. tools you can fiddle around to make your speed alittle better for alittle while, but why should we have to? There are people in this world that can't afford even 100 mbps or even get an internet connection. That really bugs me becauce some of those same people might just be the next Steve Jobs or Barbara Liskov. I don't know alot, but i'm in code camp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) and it's not like the Apple 2e i grew up with. We have come along way in a very short time seems unfair that we have to pay hundreds to companies that want to hold us back. In closing I definitely need help, think of it as charity that in the end will help all us, and maybe balance the world a little. I'm going to try hard to learn this Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200) so this can truly help someone......someitme......somehow.

                                                                                                              Thank you, Dustin
